# Group 1 BT4012 Final Project

## About the Project

This project aims to highlight and compare the effectiveness of the anomaly detection methodologies proposed in the [ADASYN: Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach for Imbalanced Learning](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ADASYN%3A-Adaptive-synthetic-sampling-approach-for-He-Bai/48234756b7cf798bfeb47328f7c5d597fd4838c2) and [Variational Autoencoder based Anomaly Detection using Reconstruction Probability](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Variational-Autoencoder-based-Anomaly-Detection-An-Cho/061146b1d7938d7a8dae70e3531a00fceb3c78e8) through high-level summaries and practical implementations of the methods on fraud-based problems such as the ULB Machine Learning Groupâ€™s [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) challenge.

## Data

The data is obtained from the Credit Card Fraud Detection [creditcard.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv).
However, due to the large file size, it is not included in this repository.

## How to Run

1. Ideally, this should be ran on Google Colab
2. Install dependencies `pip install -r bt4012-group01-requirements.txt`
3. Download data from data source.
4. Set data to relevant path.
5. Run notebook.
